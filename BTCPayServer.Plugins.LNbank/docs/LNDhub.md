# LNDhub Compatibility

LNbank offers a LNDhub-compatible API since v1.3.0.
This means that LNbank wallets are usable with the following wallet apps:

* [BlueWallet](https://bluewallet.io/)
* [Zeus](https://zeusln.app/)
* [Alby](https://getalby.com/)

These wallets offer import features, so that you can easily import your LNbank wallets into these apps.

:::tip NOTE
The prerequisite for a wallet to be accessible like this is having an access key with the admin permission tight to it.
The access keys can be managed by wallet admins on the LNbank wallet settings "Access Keys" page.

## Importing the wallet

In the wallet settings you will find the "Connect LNDhub-compatible wallet" section.
It has a QR code and the account URL, which contain the details (server URL and credentials) to connect the apps.

:::danger WARNING
The credentials allow unrestricted access to your LNbank wallet.
Treat the QR code and account URL as confidential information!
